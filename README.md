# Rev-Overcharge
Project 3 for 210607 Reston Batch.

## Project Description
Revature Overcharge is a study system for Revature trainings. Users of the application will be able to create their own flashcard sets and use flashcard sets created by other users to study. When running through a flashcard set a user will be able to type an answer before viewing the answer to a flashcard, giving them the ability to compare their answer with the real one.
